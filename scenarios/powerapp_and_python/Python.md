# Exercise 3: Build an Open AI application with Python

### Estimated Duration: 90 Minutes

In this Exercise, participants will develop an application using OpenAI's APIs and the Python programming language. The goal is to demonstrate how to implement AI functionalities such as language generation, sentiment analysis, or recommendation systems using Python, leveraging OpenAI's powerful models and tools.

1. Navigate back to the **Azure Portal**. Search **Azure Synapse Analytics (1)** and select **Azure Synapse Analytics (2)** in the Azure portal.

1. From Azure Portal, navigate to the **openaicustom-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** resource group, and select the **openai-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** Azure OpenAI resource.

    ![](images/E3S11.png)

1. Under Resource Management, select **Keys and Endpoint (1)**, and click **Show Keys (2)**. Copy **Key 1 (3)** and **Endpoint (4)**, and replace the **AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY** and **AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT** with your API key and Endpoint URL in the script.

    > **Note:** If you come across the error "OpenAI module not found," please follow these steps:

     - Add * next to 0.* to initiate the installation of the latest OpenAI module.

     - Run the "Install OpenAI" cell. Once the installation is complete, re-run the notebook.

1. For the cell under **temperature**, replace the **engine** value from **text-curie-001** to **demomodel**, and run this cell.

     ![](images/E3S14.png)

1. For the cell under **top_p**, replace the **engine** value from **text-curie-001** to **demomodel**, and run this cell.

     ![](images/E3S15.png)

1. For the cell under **n**, replace the **engine** value from **text-curie-001** to **demomodel**, and run this cell.

     ![](images/E3S16.png)

1. For the cell under **logprobs**, replace the **engine** value from **text-curie-001** to **demomodel**, and run this cell.
