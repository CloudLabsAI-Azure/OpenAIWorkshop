# Exercise 3: Build an Open AI application with Python

### Estimated Duration: 90 minutes

In this lab, participants will develop an application using OpenAI's APIs and Python programming language. The goal is to demonstrate how to implement AI functionalities such as language generation, sentiment analysis, or recommendation systems using Python, leveraging OpenAI's powerful models and tools.

1. Navigate back to the **Azure Portal**. Search **Azure Synapse Analytics (1)** and select **Azure Synapse Analytics (2)** in the Azure portal.

    > **Note:** If you come across the error "OpenAI module not found," please follow these steps:

     - Add * next to 0.* to initiate the installation of the latest OpenAI module.

     - Run the "Install OpenAI" cell. Once the installation is complete, re-run the notebook.

1. For the cell under **temperature**, replace the **engine** value from **text-curie-001** to **demomodel**, and run this cell.

     ![](images/temp.png)

1. For the cell under **top_p**, replace the **engine** value from **text-curie-001** to **demomodel**, and run this cell.
