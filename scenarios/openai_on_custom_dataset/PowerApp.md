# Exercise 2: Using Azure OpenAI on a custom dataset
### Scenario summary:
This scenario allows use cases to use Open AI as an intelligent agent to answer questions from end users or assist them using knowledge of a proprietary corpus and domain.
Applications can be:
- Giving a direct answer to questions about specific products, services, and processes based on a knowledge corpus that can be updated frequently. This is an alternative to a classic search where the result is just documents with relevant information about the question. Think of this as Bing Chat on proprietary data.
- Giving recommendations & assistance: based on information that can be implicitly gathered about the user, formulate useful content for the user's purpose. For example, a travel website may utilize users' personal information, past posts, and transaction history to personalize recommendations when users need help creating the next trip idea or itinerary.

Regardless of the application scenario, the solution flow is:
- Step 1 Prepare the context information: context information can be retrieved from proprietary knowledge corpus and other systems based on the user's query and the user's information. The retrieval mechanism can be a semantic search engine to retrieve the right content for an unstructured data corpus or an SQL query in the case of a structured dataset.
- Step 2 Formulate a prompt to Open AI: from the context and depending on the goal of the user, formulate a GPT prompt to get the final response from the end user. For example, if it's knowledge retrieval vs. recommendation

This implementation scenario focuses on building a knowledge retrieval chatbot application on top of an unstructured data corpus, but the same design can be used for the recommendation and generative scenarios.

From the user's query, the solution uses two-stage information retrieval to retrieve the content that best matches the user query. 
In stage 1, full-text search in Azure Cognitive Search is used to retrieve several relevant documents. In stage 2, the search result is applied with a pre-trained NLP model and embedded search to further narrow down the most relevant content. The content is used by the orchestrator service to form a prompt for the OpenAI deployment of LLM. The OpenAI service returns the result, which is then sent to the Power App client application.

# Task 1: Set up Azure Cognitive Search and prepare data
As part of the data preparation step, to work in Open AI, the documents are chunked into smaller units (20 lines) and stored as individual documents in the search index. The chunking steps can be achieved with the Python script below. To make it easy for the labs, the sample document has already been chunked and provided in the repo.
   
1. Login to the Azure portal if you are not already logged in.

1. Navigate to the **openaicustom-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group and select the search service with the name **search-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

1. Now select the **Semantic ranker** option from the left side menu and make sure that **Free Plan** is selected

1. Now, navigate to `C:\labfile\OpenAIWorkshop\scenarios\openai_on_custom_dataset\ingest` in Windows Explore and you will see file names as `secerts.env`, Make sure the value is updated as expected. However, we have already updated the values for you.


1. Now you need to open the **CMD** and run the below command to change the directory to the ingest folder.

   ```
   cd C:\labfile\OpenAIWorkshop\scenarios\openai_on_custom_dataset\ingest
   ```

1. Once you are in the ingest directory, run the below command to start the ingestion process. Please make sure to have the correct value in the secrets.env file before running the below command. The search indexer chunks a sample PDF document (500 pages), which is downloaded from Azure Docs, and chunks each page into 20 lines. Each chunk is created as a new search document in the index. The PDF document processing is achieved using the Azure Form Recognizer service.

     ```
     python search-indexer.py
     ```

  > **Note**: The above script will ingest the data into the services, and you will be able to continue with the lab from here. 
  
  > **Note**: Scripts will take 10 minutes to complete.

# Task 2: Import PowerApp and try out the App

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the **func-search-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** function app from the **openaicustom-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group.

   ![](./images/synapse1.3.png)

2. From the **Function app**, **Overview** page, go to **Functions** and select **orchestrator-func-app**.

   ![](./images/openai1.png)
   
3. On the **orchestrator-func-app** function, click on **Get Function Url (1)**. From the drop-down menu, select **default (function key) (2)**, then **Copy (3)** the URL. Click **OK (4)**. Paste the URL in a text editor such as Notepad for later use.

    ![](./images/get-func-url.png)

4. Navigate to https://make.powerapps.com/. On **Welcome to Power Apps**, select your **Country/Region** and click **Get Started**. 

   ![](./images/welcome-1.png)
    
5. Select **Apps (1)** on the left navigation and click **Import Canvas App (2)**. 

    ![](./images/p14.png)

6. On the **Import package** page, click on **Upload**.

    ![](./images/upload-importpackage.png)
    
7. Navigate to `C:\labfile\OpenAIWorkshop\scenarios\openai_on_custom_dataset\powerapp` and select `Semantic-Search-App-Template_20230303012916.zip` folder then click **Open**.

   ![](./images/upload-semantic-search.png)
   
8. Click on **Import** to import the package into the PowerApps environment.

    ![](./images/package-import.png)

9. Once the import is completed, click on **Apps (1)**, then click on **... (3)** next to **Semantic-Search-Template** and click on **Edit (4)**.

    ![](./images/p20.png)
     
10. Click on **Power Automate (1)**; this will import the **_Power App_** canvas and **Semantic-Search-Flow (2)** into the workspace. 

    ![](./images/semanti-search-flow-1.png)

11. To navigate back, click on **Back**; if you get an option to leave or do not leave, click on **Leave**.


12. On the **Flows (1)** pane, select **Semantic-Search-Flow (2)**, then click on `...` **(3)**, and **Turn on (4)** your flow.

      ![](./images/turn-on-flow.png)

13. Next, click on **Edit** for **Semantic-Search-Flow**. PowerAutomate Flow needs to be enabled. At this point, the Power app can be run as is. It connects to a pre-built Azure Function App. 

    ![](./images/edit.png)

14. Edit the Power Automate Flow and update **Azure Function Url (1)** with the URL you copied earlier, and append `&num_search_result=5` at the end. Your URL should look like the following: Click **Save (2)**.

    ```
    https://func-search-XXXXX.azurewebsites.net/api/orchestrator-func-app?code=aNXGfSoGqnCarlBquGQE4pNgO1n9ZmqheCd0SZPzAFCOAzFugFsV8g==&num_search_result=5
    ```
